Milestone 1

Wang Ruipeng:

The terrain is generated in chunks, each encompassing a 16x256x16 section of blocks. These chunks are stored in a map keyed by coordinates, allowing for an effective world generation in the horizontal directions. Biomes are determined using a combination of 2D Perlin noise. The Perlin noise provides the base heightfield, while Worley noise determines variation, particularly in the plains biome to simulate hills.

Plains: Utilize Worley noise to create gentle, rolling hills.
Desert: Characterized by relatively flat terrain, achieved through a specific frequency and amplitude of Perlin noise.
Mountains: Use higher amplitude in the Perlin noise to create dramatic elevation changes.
Smooth Biome Transitions

To ensure smooth transitions between biomes, I employed a technique involving smoothstep functions and a third Perlin noise map with a larger grid size. This approach increases the contrast of the Perlin noise, allowing for distinct biome areas while also providing smooth transitions.

Challenges and Solutions:

The initial implementation of noise functions and terrain generation was computationally intensive, leading to performance issues. This was mitigated by optimizing noise calculations and only updating chunks within the player's vicinity. And creating natural-looking transitions between biomes was challenging. We experimented with various interpolation techniques and noise parameters to achieve a balance between distinct biome characteristics and seamless transitions.

Han Yang: 

I implemented the efficient terrain rendering and chunking. Specifically, in create() function of a chunk, I examine each face of each block. If the block is a boundary, then we add the block data into VBO data vectors. After setting chunk as the base element of rendering, in terrain.draw, we can instead loop over every chunks and call create() for each chunk that need to be sent to VBO, like modified chunks. Also, I add a function that check whether the player is near the boundary of the terrain. If so, add a new chunk and apply the same terrain generation function on the chunk.

Cindy:
Inputs/ mygl.cpp: I edited the key events to update m_inputs instead, then process the inputs through player.cpp. I also added mouse events, where when the mouse moves, the camera would rotate, and add blocks with right click and remove blocks with left click.

Tick/ mygl.cpp and player.cpp: invoked tick from player from tick from MyGL, and I calculated the delta time through the currentMSecsSinceEpoch() function.

Process inputs/player.cpp: I used m_inputs gotten from mygl.cpp to calculate the accerlation with different keys pressed. My jump however currently goes up but doesnt come down, and my flight mode would fly really high. The player moves based on the acceleration and the calculated velocity. For friction, I apply 0.95 of the current velocity everytime. For gravity, I did -100 on the y axis to mimic the gravity multiplied by the mass.

collisions/player.cpp: I used raycasting and gridmarch to check the collision on all three normals, assyming that the cube size of the player is the same as the cube of everything else

Add and remove blocks/player.cpp: I used ray casting to find the blcok that intersects within the radius of three, then for remove, I set the block to EMPTY, and for add, I set the block to DIRT.

Milestone 2

Wang Ruipeng:
I helped Cindy fix the bugs on milestone 1 first. The original code she submitted was unable to work properly in many situations, so I have to rewrite a lot of part of her code:

1. Her code calculated the delta time in the currentMSecsSinceEpoch() function through a wrong way which takes milliseconds as seconds, resulting in the player velocity being ridiculously small while acceleration being ridiculously large. This may answer her question above in the Process inputs parts. I helped improved her code by changing certain parameters.
2. The collision part is not working properly because she calculates the player position, player velocity and acceleration in wrong order. This makes the clamped velocity after collision will not be processed until next frame, resulting in a jittering collision when player hits a block. I fixed this problem by changing dynamic parameters processing order.
3. I also completely rewrote her ray casting function to match the functions on the slides given by Adam. Her original implementation of the ray casting function will result in mistakenly place the blocks somewhere randomly around the desired location. 
4. I also helped her fixed the code she has written for dealing with input which cannot run on the windows platform. The moveMouseToCenter() logic is not being called at the right time.
5. Finally, I corrected some spelling mistakes in her milestone1 readme.txt.

These problems could be addressed before the deadline of milestone1. However, Cindy was extremely busy that week because she had to rehearse for an acapella show and therefore unable to respond message in time. Despite this minor issue, the collaboration is overall quite a good experience. I would appreciate it more if the code passed down by Cindy was more polished and proofread so that it would save us more time to further prepare and develop for milestone 2.

Then, for multithreading terrain generation, I rearranged Hanâ€™s code to make it better suited for multithreading purpose. The VBO calculation part and the VBO binding was then separated into 2 processes since the binding process cannot be multithreaded. Here is the major update:

1. In MyGL::tick() function, the chunk update function is changed into m_terrain.multithreadedTerrainUpdate(). The original check_edge() is not used now. People may switch back to original check_edge() rendering function though, just change the line in the MyGL::tick() and remember to call buff_data() after createVBOdata() for each chunk.
2. The BlockGenerateWorker and VBOWorker class is stored in the chunkworker.cpp file, which stores each thread for running. The terrain generation code is now moved into the chunk class because the setBlock is done through the unordered_map m_chunk in terrain class, which is not thread safe. I try to add lock when accessing m_chunk, however, this does not work out fine. There was no dead lock and the data was simply unable to sent to VBO.
3. The thread is based on Qt runnable I tried C++ mutex first but considering it is rather unpolished so I decided to switch to Qt multithreading class instead.
4. As per instructed, the VBO data is now stored as a struct in the chunk class. The struct contains two separated VBO data, one for opaque object and the other one is for transparent. The transparent is reserved for the people who will be doing texturing part. However, it is uninitialized, so you might need to fill them accordingly.
5. I also implemented the cave system for procedural generation using 3D Perlin noise.

However, after the new rendering pipeline, the destroy and place block is not functioning. I will try to fix this problem. I am pushing this version at 11/17 now wishing to give other teammates who not yet start on milestone 2 a good place to start and test their code efficiently. The problem should be in the rendering as far as I am concerned. I will update as soon as the bug got fixed.
